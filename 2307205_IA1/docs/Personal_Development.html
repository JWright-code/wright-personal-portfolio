          <p class="profile-text">
            I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Through my coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed advanced programming skills—particularly in Java and C—as well as strong problem-solving abilities focused on designing efficient solutions to problem statements by honing my problem-solving mindset.

            <h3>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
            <p>
              In Chapter 4, “Achieve Your Goals,” the authors stress the transformative power of setting clear, written goals and breaking them down into manageable steps. They explain that writing down even one hundred aspirations forces you to clarify your vision and work toward becoming the person capable of achieving those dreams. This idea resonated with me, as I see a parallel with my journey in computer science and my transformative journey as a person. In my opinion, it places emphasis on the journey—forcing yourself to evolve and become better—as that is the only way to achieve bigger things. It prompted reflection as I’ve constantly pondered, “Am I yet the person I need to be to achieve my goals?” My goals are a driving force, a fire in the pit of my stomach that pushes me forward and forces me to become a better version of myself, rather than taking the easy way out. In focusing on specific, tangible, and measurable objectives, only then can I devise plans to accomplish them. “Just decide what you want to do and then get started. That is one of the most powerful lessons in life.”

            <h3>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
            <p>
              Chapter 5, “The Proper Use of Time,” teaches that time is our most valuable resource, urging us to focus on the important rather than merely the urgent. The authors highlight that every day holds many opportunities, but success comes from dedicating ourselves to the one best opportunity that aligns with our long-term goals. I have often fallen into the trap of focusing on the urgent rather than the important—trapped in a never-ending cycle of lectures, assignments, projects, and personal obligations. However, upon reflection, I am the master of time. By adopting a more consistent time management approach, I can prioritize what truly matters in getting me where I need to be by first becoming who I need to be.

            <h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
            <p>
              In Chapter 6, “Surround Yourself With the Best People,” the narrative focuses on the influence our social circle has on our personal and professional development. The book advises evaluating our relationships to ensure they inspire and challenge us rather than hold us back. This message hit home for me as a student; it reminds me to seek out peers, mentors, and networks that foster a positive learning environment and encourage continuous improvement in a rapidly evolving tech industry. I’m grateful to be surrounded by people who inspire me, yet it also serves as a reminder to remain open to new associations that provide the same effect.

            <h3>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
            <p>
              Chapter 7, “Be a Life-Long Learner,” underscores the necessity of continuously acquiring new knowledge and skills throughout life. The authors stress that success is not a destination but a continuous journey of growth and adaptation. This concept aligns perfectly with the field of computer science, where staying updated with emerging technologies is crucial. It inspires me not only to rely on the curriculum but also to engage in self-directed learning through online courses, coding challenges, and tech seminars. Books have always been an immense source of inspiration, yet this chapter encourages me to consistently seek out new information to expand my mind and spark ideas that benefit my family, community, and country.

            <p>
              In summary, my understanding of these chapters is that success is built on a solid foundation of clear goal-setting, disciplined time management, positive and growth-oriented relationships, and an unwavering commitment to lifelong learning. By integrating these pillars into my daily routine as a computer science student, I can effectively navigate the challenges of academia and position myself for a thriving career in a constantly changing technological landscape.
