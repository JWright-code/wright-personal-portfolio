              <p>
                I’ve always been completely captivated by animals – both the wild majesty of lions, the brilliance of elephants or the quirky charm of my own household pets. I find it fascinating how wild animals can have social structures and formations to attack pray. There is much to be learned from the natural world. There's something so magical about how they show unconditional love and teach us about compassion every single day. I love diving into fascinating stories and cool facts about wildlife, and I often find myself exploring amazing animal adventures over at National Geographic. It’s a constant reminder of how beautiful and surprising our world can be!"

              <p>
                I love books—books allow me to transport myself to new worlds, have new experiences, and immerse myself in my characters.<br><br>
                I've read at least once per week every week for two years (according to my Kindle), and once the semester starts, I read every day—there's nothing like elves, dragons, and wizards to help you relax while trying to solve a tough problem.<br><br>
                Books allow me to be both curious and determined—two of my strongest and most defining traits.<br><br>
                Through my books, I can travel to Istanbul or explore famous libraries, or even stop an assassination plot. They expand my thoughts, allow me to become open to new ideas, and show me what’s possible with a sprinkle of imagination.

              <p>
                My insatiable curiosity drives me to learn and share new information every chance I get. One of the greatest wonders of our modern world is that knowledge is always at our fingertips—I can explore the streets, savor the food, and immerse myself in the culture of a country without ever setting foot there. Whether I’m diving into the captivating history of the ancient Egyptians or uncovering hidden gems from across the globe, every discovery sparks my passion for exploration. It’s this love for research that not only fuels my determination but also makes me eager to share these incredible insights with everyone I meet.

            <h3>Academics & Learning</h3>
            <p>
                My strongest trait is my curiosity, paired with an unyielding determination. These two qualities have a profound impact on my academic life.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In school, I’m constantly driven to learn, to deepen my understanding, and to explore new concepts. Whether it’s diving deeper into the realms of object-oriented programming or exploring complex theories, my love for learning pushes me to go beyond the surface.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                It’s not just about acquiring knowledge—it's the excitement that comes with discovering new possibilities, breaking down problems, and coming up with innovative solutions.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Research is another area where my curiosity grows—whether it's books, articles, or videos, I immerse myself in new ideas that elevate my academic pursuits.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This passion for learning equips me with the tools to excel in my academic journey while fueling my desire to share knowledge with others, helping both myself and those around me grow.

              I would say that the test is valid both in general and individually. Based on the results, I am accurately an orderly person who focuses on making plans, is not very materialistic, and can be a bit obsessive when it comes to getting everything just right which is further supported by the claims from my close family members that I’m not at all an easygoing person. The careers listed that might interest me are very similar to those I considered before choosing programming.

            <h2>"The World Belongs to the Enthusiastic" - Judian Wright</h2>
            <p>
                The person I look up to the most is undoubtedly my mother. She pushes me to be brave and bold, teaching me that it’s okay to fail and make mistakes because that’s how we learn. One of the most important lessons she taught me is that my voice, my opinion, and my values matter—that I matter, and that my voice deserves to be heard. Her unwavering optimism, love, and determination inspire me every day to share my voice and grow into someone even more unapologetically myself.
